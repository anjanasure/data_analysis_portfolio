# Anjana Suresh - Data Science Portfolio
## About
Hi, Anjana here! I have a Master's degree in Physics from the University of Cologne, where I specialized in Astronomy. I have been interested in programming ever since learning Java in high school. I then went on to learn Python during my Bachelor's degree (2015-2018). I have been consistently expanding my knowledge in data science through lectures and assignments during my university years, before landing my first Working Student job in Data Science at a large IT Consultancy in Germany in 2022. 
<!-- write about what this repo is for --> 
I created this repository to share some of my personal projects I worked on to build my data science skills.

## Portfolio
### Credit Risk Analysis
**Code:** [German_credit_score.ipynb](https://github.com/anjanasure/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/German_credit_score.ipynb) <br>
**Description:**  The dataset consists of 1000 rows containing socio-economic data about the applicant's background as features and credit risk as the target variable. The features include age, gender and marital status amongst other information like whether the applicant owns property and how long they have been employed. The target variable tells whether the applicant has good or bad credit risk. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and pre-processing, EDA, training a few different ML models and hyperparameter tuning.  
**Skills:** EDA, scikit-learn, data visualization, hyperparameter tuning  
**Result:** Developed ML models to predict whether an applicant has good or bad credit risk.  

### Employee Satisfaction Survey Analysis [in process]
**Code:** [Employee_Satisfaction_Survey.ipynb](https://github.com/anjanasure/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/Employee_Satisfaction_Survey.ipynb) (Deutsch/English)  
**Description:** With this dataset, I look into a simulated survey of employees from an organization and see how sociodemographic factors affect the overall job satisfaction of employees. The features will be used to predict the target variable "Allgemeine Zufriedenheit" (overall satisfaction).  
**Skills:** EDA, scikit-learn, chi-square-test, feature engineering  
**Result:** Developed a model to predict the overall satisfaction of employees at their workplace.
